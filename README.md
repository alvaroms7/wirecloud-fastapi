WireCloud builds on cutting-edge end-user development, RIA and semantic
technologies to offer a next-generation end-user centred web application mashup
platform aimed at leveraging the long tail of the Internet of Services.

WireCloud builds on cutting-edge end-user (software) development, RIA and
semantic technologies to offer a next-generation end-user centred web
application mashup platform aimed at allowing end users without programming
skills to easily create web applications and dashboards/cockpits (e.g. to
visualize their data of interest or to control their domotized home or
environment). Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application
logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent
and value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the
"long tail" of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploiting
rapid development, DIY, and shareability. They typically serve a specific
situational (i.e. immediate, short-lived, customized) need, frequently with high
potential for reuse. Is this "situational" character which precludes them to be
offered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and therefore
creates the need for a tool like WireCloud.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information
check the FIWARE Catalogue entry for
[Context Processing, Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/processing).

## Quick start

The fastest way to run the complete stack is Docker Compose. It builds
WireCloud and starts MongoDB and Elasticsearch with persistent volumes:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec wirecloud python -m manage populate
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec wirecloud python -m manage createsuperuser
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/>. Before exposing the service, replace
`WIRECLOUD_JWT_KEY` and `WIRECLOUD_SECRET_KEY` in `docker/.env` with different,
secure random values.

For health checks, updates, persistent-storage guidance, and troubleshooting,
follow the complete [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.md).

| Create workspaces and connect components | [User guide](docs/user-guide.md) |
| Deploy and configure an instance | [Installation](docs/installation.md) and [configuration](docs/configuration.md) |
| Operate, back up, and restore WireCloud | [Administration](docs/administration.md) |

| Customize the interface or backend | [Themes](docs/themes.md) and [plugins](docs/plugins.md) |
| Migrate an existing deployment | [Migration guide](docs/migration.md) |

Release wheels and the forthcoming PyPI package include the compiled frontend,
so Node.js is not required on the deployment host. See the
[installation guide](docs/installation.md) for all supported installation
paths and an example project-specific configuration.

## Development

WireCloud requires Python 3.9 or newer and Node.js with npm. To prepare a local
checkout:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e '.[test,migration]'
npm ci
npm run build
```

Run the Python and JavaScript test suites with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov
npm run test:js:cov
```

The [contributor guide](docs/development.md) covers local services, frontend
commands, translations, packaging, continuous integration, and documentation
builds.

## Documentation

The documentation is built with MkDocs and published on
[Read the Docs](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/). Build it locally in strict
mode to catch broken links and configuration errors:

```bash
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
mkdocs build --strict
```

version 3](LICENSE). Widgets, operators, and mashups running on the platform are
expressly excluded from the covered work and may use other licenses; see the
license file for the complete terms.
