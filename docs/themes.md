# Creating themes

Themes change WireCloud's presentation without changing its application behavior. They can provide colors and typography, images, compiled CSS and JavaScript, translated labels, and selected Jinja templates. Theme inheritance makes a small branding theme possible without copying the whole default interface.

Creating a theme currently requires a custom WireCloud build. The Python loader imports themes from `wirecloud.themes`, and the frontend build scans `src/wirecloud/themes` for `theme.ts` files. Add the theme to the source tree before running Webpack.

## Start with an inherited theme

Create this structure:

```text
src/wirecloud/themes/acmetheme/
├── __init__.py
├── theme.ts
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── acme.scss
│   └── images/
│       └── logos/
│           └── header.png
└── templates/
    └── wirecloud/
        └── views/
            └── header.html
```

Only add files that the child theme changes. All other templates and static files are resolved through its parent.

### Python metadata

`__init__.py` must define `parent` and `label`:

```python
from wirecloud.translation import gettext_lazy as _

parent = "defaulttheme"
label = _("Acme")
```

Set `parent = None` only for a complete root theme that supplies everything WireCloud needs. An inherited theme is safer because new parent templates and assets remain available after an upgrade.

The module name, directory name, and configured theme name must match exactly. A missing `parent` attribute is a configuration error. A parent that cannot be imported ends the inheritance chain, usually causing missing templates or assets later, so validate the name carefully.

### Frontend manifest

`theme.ts` tells Webpack which extra CSS and scripts belong to each view:

```typescript
const parent: string | null = "defaulttheme";

const getCSS = (view: string): string[] => {
    if (view === "classic" || view === "smartphone") {
        return ["css/acme.scss"];
    }
    return [];
};

const getScripts = (view: string): string[] => {
    return [];
};

export default {
    parent,
    get_css: getCSS,
    get_scripts: getScripts
};
```

The recognized bundle views include `classic`, `smartphone`, `embedded`, `widget`, `operator`, and `bootstrap`. CSS bundles are produced for platform views and widget rendering. Return files only for views that need them.

Paths are relative to the theme's `static` directory. A child can replace a parent asset by supplying the same relative path. For example, `static/images/logos/header.png` replaces the parent logo wherever that path is requested.

When overriding a parent stylesheet, placing a child file at the same relative path causes the build to use the child file for that entry. Prefer a small additional stylesheet for ordinary branding, and replace a parent stylesheet only when its rules or Sass structure genuinely need to change. Check the resulting cascade because parent and child entries can both contribute rules.

## Templates

Template lookup starts in the active theme and continues through its parents. To customize the header, copy the parent's relative template path:

```text
templates/wirecloud/views/header.html
```

Templates use Jinja syntax. Common helpers include:

- `trans("Text")` for theme-aware translation;
- `static("images/example.png")` for an asset URL; and
- `url("symbolic.route.name", argument=value)` for a URL contributed by the platform or a plugin.

Keep overrides narrow. Copying a large parent template freezes its structure in the child and makes later parent changes harder to adopt.

Plugins may declare additional template fragments through their `get_templates` hook. Every enabled theme must supply or inherit those paths; otherwise `/api/theme/{theme}` reports the missing template. This is one reason presentation-only changes belong in themes while new behavior belongs in [plugins](plugins.md).

## Translations

For a translatable theme label or template strings, catalogue files use the theme name as their gettext domain:

```text
locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/acmetheme.po
locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/acmetheme.mo
```

Generate and compile them from the repository root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m manage gentranslations --language es
PYTHONPATH=src python -m manage compiletranslations --language es
```

Theme translation lookup follows the same child-to-parent chain as templates.

## Build and enable the theme

Build assets after adding or changing `theme.ts`, Sass, CSS, or JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then make the theme available. With the Docker settings format:

```text
WIRECLOUD_AVAILABLE_THEMES=defaulttheme,acmetheme
WIRECLOUD_THEME_ACTIVE=acmetheme
```

`WIRECLOUD_THEME_ACTIVE` must be present in the available list. Restart WireCloud after changing theme settings. In a source settings module, use the equivalent values:

```python
AVAILABLE_THEMES = ["defaulttheme", "acmetheme"]
THEME_ACTIVE = "acmetheme"
```

An available theme can be previewed without making it the default by adding `?themeactive=acmetheme` to a WireCloud workspace URL. The value is accepted only when it is in `AVAILABLE_THEMES`.

## Test checklist

Test every view your users rely on:

- anonymous landing and authenticated login pages;
- classic and mobile workspace views;
- My Resources, resource details, and upload dialogs;
- workspace editing, widget menus, and the wiring editor;
- embedded workspaces and widgets using platform styles;
- error pages; and
- every enabled language.

Also test missing images and fonts in the browser network panel, keyboard focus, contrast, narrow screens, and a production-mode `npm run build`. A successful Webpack build proves that assets compile, but not that inherited templates remain visually compatible.

## Packaging and upgrades

The current build discovers frontend themes from the WireCloud source tree rather than from arbitrary external Python packages. Maintain a small patch layer or derived source/image build containing `src/wirecloud/themes/acmetheme`, and rebuild it for each WireCloud release. Keep theme code under version control and compare overridden parent files during upgrades.
