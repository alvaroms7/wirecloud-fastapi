# Migrating from WireCloud 1

WireCloud 2 includes an importer for a Django-based WireCloud instance backed by MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. The importer reads the old SQL database and calls the old instance over HTTP to retrieve packaged resources.

## What is imported

The command attempts to migrate:

- constants;
- users, groups, and their mappings;
- marketplace definitions;
- catalogue resources and access rules;
- workspaces, tabs, widget instances, preferences, and sharing rules; and
- version 2.0 wiring configurations and operators.

Unsupported or inconsistent records are reported while the importer continues where possible. A wiring configuration whose stored version is not `2.0` is skipped.

## Before migrating

1. Back up the old SQL database and old application files.
2. Back up the destination if it contains any data.
3. Keep the old WireCloud HTTP service reachable during the import.
4. Obtain an old-instance superuser account and direct SQL read credentials.
5. Configure and start the WireCloud 2 destination with MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
6. Install migration dependencies in the environment that will run the command with `python -m pip install '.[migration]'`. The supplied runtime container does not install this extra; use a source environment or build a derived migration image rather than modifying a running production container.

Run the migration against a fresh destination. The command can reuse some existing users and groups, but name conflicts can skip workspaces or produce a partial result; it is not designed as continuous synchronization.

## Run the importer

MySQL example:

```bash
python -m manage migrate \
  --url https://old-wirecloud.example.com \
  --admin-user old-admin \
  --admin-password 'OLD_ADMIN_PASSWORD' \
  --db-type mysql \
  --db-host old-db.example.com \
  --db-name wirecloud \
  --db-user migration_reader \
  --db-password 'OLD_DATABASE_PASSWORD'
```

PostgreSQL uses `--db-type postgresql`; the default port becomes 5432. For SQLite, provide the database file as `--db-name` and omit database host/user/password options:

```bash
python -m manage migrate \
  --url http://old-wirecloud.internal:8000 \
  --admin-user old-admin \
  --admin-password 'OLD_ADMIN_PASSWORD' \
  --db-type sqlite \
  --db-name /srv/old-wirecloud/db.sqlite3
```

The command displays its source and requests confirmation. Add `--yes` only in reviewed automation. `--no-verify-ssl` disables verification for the old server and should be limited to a controlled migration network with a known certificate problem.

!!! warning
    Command-line passwords can be visible in shell history and process listings. Run the migration from a restricted administration host, use short-lived credentials, and rotate them afterward.

## Validate the result

Capture the command output and review every warning or failed record. Then:

```bash
python -m manage populate
python -m manage rebuildsearchindexes
```

Verify at least:

- administrator and normal-user login;
- user/group membership and permissions;
- private and public workspace access;
- catalogue package downloads and widget rendering;
- tab layouts and component preferences;
- wiring connections and operator behavior; and
- resource and workspace search.

Keep the old instance read-only until owners have validated representative workspaces. If the import must be repeated, restore a clean destination backup first rather than importing over the partial destination.
